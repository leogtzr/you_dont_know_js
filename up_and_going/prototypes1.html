        When you reference a property on an object, if that property doesn’texist, JavaScript will automatically use that object’s 
        internalprototype reference to find another object to look for the property on.You could think of this almost as a fallback if 
        the property is missing.The internal prototype reference linkage from one object to its fallbackhappens at 
        the time the object is created. The simplest way toillustrate it is with a built-in utility called Object.create(..).
